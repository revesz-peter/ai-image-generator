# AI Image Generator

AI Image Generator is a web application that uses OpenAI's DALL-E model to generate images based on user input. The application is built with the MERN stack, Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and uses Cloudinary for cloud-based image storage.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can access the live demo of the application at [https://canvasofdalle.cloud](https://canvasofdalle.cloud). (Please note, you might need to refresh your browser to ping the server and wait for a few seconds, as the server goes to sleep after being inactive for a while).
